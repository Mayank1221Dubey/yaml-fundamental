indicaters in yaml 
"?" indicater - the question mark (?) is used as an indicator to define keys.
this is optional.

example A -
user:
  name: John
  age: 30
  is_student?: true
example B -
user:
  name: John
  age: 30
  is_student: true
Note -------------------------- both example A and B are same

'&' indicater - It is used to mark a node for aliasing.
'*' indicater -  is used as an indicator for creating aliases and 
references within the document.

example --
# Define a person with some attributes
person: &person_details
  name: John Doe
  age: 30
  occupation: Developer

# Reference the person details using an alias
employee:
  details: *person_details
  department: Engineering

The resulting structure would be -
employee:
  details:
    name: John Doe
    age: 30
    occupation: Developer
  department: Engineering
